#Weather dashboard

When I click search, I creat an AJAX request that gets weather data and appends it to the page.
ALSO, that searched city is saved as a button in the left column of the page
When any of the saved city buttons are clicked, it performs the same AJAX request for that city

Search box event listener
previously searched event listener


AJAX 1, 2, and 3
